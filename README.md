>Step 2: Select Open a Model and navigate to the Sample_Threat Model_https.tm7  file you downloaded earlier.

>Step 3: Notice that there is a Stencils panel on the right of the screen. Stencils are used to add components to a diagram. Explore the components used in the model to make sure you understand the diagram.

>Step 4: Switch to Analysis View by selecting the Switch to Analysis View button in the toolbar in the top left corner of the screen (page with magnifying glass icon).

>Step 5: Notice that the Threat List panel now shows the possible threats in a list below the diagram. Select one of the threats in the list to view the Threat Properties panel that contains additional information about the specific threat.

>You can download the threat list as a CSV file by selecting Export CSV. This gives you a structured and easily accessible record of identified threats that you can share with stakeholders who do not have the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool installed. You can also use it to perform further analysis, sorting, filtering, or data manipulation as needed. View a sample of the exported CSV file here:

>Step 6: Select the Reports menu in the top toolbar and then select Create Full Report.
